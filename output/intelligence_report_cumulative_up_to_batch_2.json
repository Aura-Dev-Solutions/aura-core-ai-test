      "- Issue: billing page doesn't remember user preferences for billing history - Severity: Medium — annoying repetitive friction - Frequency: Every login / session start - User Impact: Users reconfigure billing history settings each time before they can recover from a billing history error - Suggested Fix: Persist billing history preferences per user across sessions",
      "- Issue: Error messages when attempting to find usage dashboard in the interface are unhelpful — just says 'Something went wrong' - Severity: Critical — users cannot self-recover - Frequency: Occurs when usage dashboard input exceeds undocumented limits in subscription area - User Impact: Users contact support or abandon the task entirely - Suggested Fix: Add specific error messages with recovery steps for usage dashboard",
      "billing history takes way too many clicks",

      "- Request: Saved views / presets for usage dashboard in account billing - Requester: P-116 - Use Case: Different team members need different usage dashboard configurations to connect usage dashboard to external tools - Priority: Medium — reduces daily setup time - Similar Requests: Came up in 4/6 sessions this round - Suggested Implementation: Named presets with share-to-team capability",
      "Really interesting feature request from today — the participant wants keyboard shortcuts for everything in account billing, especially plan upgrade. They showed me how they customize plan upgrade to fit their needs using only the keyboard in a competitor tool and it was dramatically faster. They said switching to the mouse for every plan upgrade interaction feels like 'going back to the Stone Age.' I think a command palette approach could solve this without building individual shortcuts.",
      "Esto es un pain point importante — P-060 needs real-time collaboration on billing history in payment section. Currently their team takes turns and uses a spreadsheet to track who's working on what to avoid conflicts when they share billing history configurations with team. They explicitly compared it to Google Docs and said 'if this worked like that, it would save us hours of coordination.' Given how many teams we're seeing with this pattern, I think collaborative editing should be on the roadmap.",
      "The participant asked if we have an API for invoice download because they want to automate the share invoice download configurations with team process in billing page. They're an engineer by background and said their team has already built scripts for other tools and would 'absolutely build automation' if endpoints were available. This aligns with what I'm hearing from enterprise accounts — programmatic access is becoming table stakes."
