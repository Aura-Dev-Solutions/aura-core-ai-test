      "Esto es un pain point importante — P-102 needs real-time collaboration on Zapier integration in integrations hub. Currently their team takes turns and uses a spreadsheet to track who's working on what to avoid conflicts when they customize Zapier integration to fit their needs. They explicitly compared it to Google Docs and said 'if this worked like that, it would save us hours of coordination.' Given how many teams we're seeing with this pattern, I think collaborative editing should be on the roadmap. (muy frustrante para el participante)"
